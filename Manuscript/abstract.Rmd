# Abstract

Contributions:

* joint fusion

    * NNLS

    * multi-threaded

    * remove directionality bias in search neighborhood

    * open-source implementation in ANTs (ITK-Style)

    * joint intensity fusion

* corrective learning

    * replace AdaBoost framework with random forest

    * binary labels correct classification vs. misclassification (old) vs. four labels
      (true, false) $\times$ (positive, negative).

    * open source R implementation

        * ``segmentationRefinement.train``
        * ``segmentationRefinement.predict``

* remove study-specific "heuristics"

* T1/T2 evaluation on three publicly available data sets + 1 private data set (which will also be made
  publicly available?)

    * Yushkevich "PennData"

    * MniData

    * Winterburn data

    * Stark training set

* T1 only evaluation on the same data sets
