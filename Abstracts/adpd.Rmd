MULTI-ATLAS INTENSITY AND LABEL FUSION WITH SUPERVISED SEGMENTATION REFINEMENT FOR THE SUBPARCELLATION OF THE HIPPOCAMPUS

Objectives: To better characterize progression of neurodegenerative diseases which
involve the hippocampus (such as Alzheimer's disease), significant research focus
has been devoted to the accurate delineation of the hippocampus and its subfields.
Due to the insights gained from "big data" efforts, such as ADNI, automation of
these techniques is an absolute necessity.

Methods:  We detail a significant modification of the ASHS (Automatic
Segmentation of Hippocampal Subfields) framework [1] made available as open-source
through the well-known Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTs) and its R-based extension,
ANTsR.  Innovations include a new joint label fusion (JLF) implementation
with the use of non-negative least squares (NNLS) for weighting of individual atlases and
subsequent refinement to remove systematic labeling error employs a four-class
random forest (RF) approach based on true/false x positive/negative classifications.  
A leave-one-out evaluation was performed on two data sets (one public and one private)
consisting of separate subparcellation schemes (denoted as "Penn" and "UCI")

Results:  Warping of individual atlases to the target image resulted in an
average Dice value over all labels:  Penn: left = 0.587, right = 0.570 and UCI:
left = 0.667, right = 0.680.  NNLS JLF:  Penn:  left = 0.751, right = 0.744 and
UCI:  left = 0.776, right = 0.779.  RF Refinement:  Penn:  left = 0.762, right =
0.754 and UCI:  left = 0.793, right = 0.785.

Conclusions:  We provide an open-source pipeline for estimation of hippocampal
subfields using consensus labeling and refinement which yields good performance.
Results were applied to T1/T2 data but the framework is sufficiently general to
accommodate other imaging protocols (e.g. T1-only).
